  				<h1>MANILA TORTILLA</h1>
  				<p>When fresh, our tortillas are best eaten soft, simply warmed through. Serve them in a basket and eat as you would bread alongside a meal or fill with a topping for soft tacos.
  				</br></br>
				After a few days, when dried out slightly, our tortillas can be fried or baked (either cut up or whole) to give them a new lease of life – just as stale bread is great toasted. These are for dishes such as tostadas, chilaquiles, crispy tacos, flautas and of course nacho chips.
